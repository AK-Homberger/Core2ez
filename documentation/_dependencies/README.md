# Dependencies for building on ReadTheDocs

Currently this holds a submodule which links to Rop's fork of breathe that has
support for `:membergroups:` and `:members-only:` so it can be installed in the
ReadTheDocs virtual environment until upstream breathe package takes PR.

See `/.gitmodules` as well as `/.readthedocs.yaml` and `/documentation/conf.py`
