# Core2ez

## Warning: no active development...

Core2ez is a self-contained widget-based environment that has the usual set of buttons, input field, checkbox and a number of other interface elements, with deluixe addons like multi-touch and multi-channel ADSR sound synth built-in.

I've wanted to create something that was like [M5ez](https://github.com/m5ez/m5ez), but more suited to the M5Stack Core2 device which has a touch screen instead of three buttons. This was my first go at a widget-based programming environment, and while I had a ton of fun building it, I have also come to realize how much work it would be to make this into what I'd like to be. On top of that, others have done what I was doing. If you need a serious windowing environment, I suggest looking at [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) where I have helped to better support the M5Stack Core2.

That said: I'll leave it up because for some purposes this will be just right, and it does what it does without too many problems. Just know that it's unlikely to see further development.
